title: Model Validate Search
description: |
  This search validates the model by comparing the predictions with the actual values.
  It uses the RandomForest model trained in the previous step.
  The model is validated on the same data that was used for training.
  The search computes the confusion matrix and accuracy of the model.
  The model is saved to the "adaptive-threashold_ml_model" index.

    Create 4 blocks (morning, lunch, afternoon, night).
    Adjust hour ranges as desired:
    - Morning:   6 AM–10:59 AM
    - Lunch:     11 AM–1:59 PM
    - Afternoon: 2 PM–5:59 PM
    - Night:     everything else
  ```
  | eval block_of_day = case(
      hour_of_day >= 6 AND hour_of_day < 11, "morning",
      hour_of_day >= 11 AND hour_of_day < 14, "lunch",
      hour_of_day >= 14 AND hour_of_day < 18, "afternoon",
      1=1, "night"
  )

  ```
    Aggregate by kpi_name (one row per KPI).
    Compute overall average/stdev plus stdev for each time block.
  ```
  | stats 
      avg(value) as overall_avg
      stdev(value) as overall_stdev
      stdev(eval(if(block_of_day=="morning",   value, NULL))) as stdev_morning
      stdev(eval(if(block_of_day=="lunch",     value, NULL))) as stdev_lunch
      stdev(eval(if(block_of_day=="afternoon", value, NULL))) as stdev_afternoon
      stdev(eval(if(block_of_day=="night",     value, NULL))) as stdev_night
      by kpi_name fit_label

  ```
    Train a RandomForest model on these features. 
    "fit_label" is our target (fit, not_fit, maybe_fit).
  ```
  | fit RandomForestClassifier fit_label 
        from overall_avg overall_stdev 
            stdev_morning stdev_lunch 
            stdev_afternoon stdev_night
        into "KPI_fitness_model"
