Okay for the 3rd version of this, we're going to take a different approach to the dev. Scratchpad will elaborate.

############# PROBLEM #############
We have a CSV that contains a large list of KPI averages rolled up by their average value (alert_value) for that hour. 
This data lives, and is desplayed, in Splunk, and there's about 2000 unique KPIs all with a variety of values/spikes/downtime. 
These KPIs have very different meanings as well; 
    * some indicate CPU usage on Netowrking devices, 
    * some indicate user MFA logins
    * some indicate 
Some of this data is relatively consistent, which is to say it follows a pattern. User MFA logins are one such example:
    There will be a spike of activity in the morning, some activity throughout the day, probably another spike from 1-2 PM and then a complete falloff in the night.
    Some of this data is going to be completely sporatic throughout the day/night, like CPU %

We wish to be able to identify what data is "consistent" and what data is "eratic"

This is not about identifying what data has the exact same averages over time, but rather about identifying consistent patterns among each individual KPI
For example:
    * Does a KPI spike every day from 9-11 and then again from 12-2? And then regularly fall off completely from 8PM-6AM?
    * Does a KPI remain relatively static (allowing some variance) from 8-5 and then fall off completely from 8PM-6AM?
    * Is a KPI completely void of any pattern, spikes at 9AM on 11/1, 2, 5, 7, 12, but almost no activity at 9AM on the 3, 4, 6, 8-11?

Again I state the importance of identifying the patterns in the entire data set, days, weeks, months, less so about the exact number. 

############# NOTES/CONTEXT #############

The avg(alert_value) is the calculated value of the kpi. 
The reason he did average was to get it down to one hour chunks, since kpis can be at 1, 5, or 15 minutes intervals.

So, for example:
"2024-11-07T10:00:00.000-0600",8bc396b123a830ffd877b3ec,"432.4989059080963"

The avg value for the kpi in the hour 10:00:00.000 is 432.4989059080963
And the values for all subsequent KPIs will be represented in a similar way.

Some of the data in this CSV skips a couple of hours at a time

Like 
2024-10-30T19:00:00.000-0500	8bc396b123a830ffd877b3ec	0.6666666666666670
2024-10-31T06:00:00.000-0500	8bc396b123a830ffd877b3ec	786.4873646209390
2024-10-31T07:00:00.000-0500	8bc396b123a830ffd877b3ec	369.58086560364500

Some of the data in this CSV includes these, however, the missing-hours should be inferred as "0s" - thus, the model also needs to account for seasonality
Not all data will be represented in this, the model also needs to account for this.

Thus, it's crucial that time plays a key role here. 

"Consistent" data here is not so much that the average value is the same, but that there WERE consistent values at that same hour rollup for the average of the entire data set.

Take this value, for example:
2024-11-27T06:00:00.000-0600	8bc396b123a830ffd877b3ec	717.1698113207550

Was there a similar average on the 26th? The 25th? 24th? Etc... 

This is going to be tricky, because weekends and holiday's must be accounted for as well.
